> Analysis of StackOverflow 2017 survey

The aim was to analyze the StackOverflow 2017 survey. I decided to reply to 3 questions:
1. Which are the jobs that satisfied the most the repliers?
2. Are there some countries where people are more satisfied?
3. What are the main characteristics of a satisfying job?

The following notebook contains all the data processes and display used to reply to these questions.
